title: "Qumulo-Certified Platinum-Tier Hardware Servicing Guide"
summary: 'The Platinum Tier includes platforms developed with our manufacturing partners, who either customize existing node types (OEM) or design and build them from scratch (ODM). The Qumulo-Certified Platinum-Tier Hardware Servicing Guide provides information about installing Qumulo Core on Platinum-Tier node types and guidance on node racking and wiring, configuring out-of-band management ports (iLO or IPMI), drive bay mapping, panel LEDs, cluster networking, and replacement of hardware components. For platforms that this guide doesn&apos;t cover, see the <a href="https://docs.qumulo.com/gold-tier-hardware-servicing-guide">Gold-Tier Hardware Servicing Guide for Qumulo</a>.'
