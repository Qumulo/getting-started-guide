## Step 1: Boot by Using the Qumulo Core USB Drive Installer
1. Insert a USB drive with the [Qumulo Core installer](creating-usb-drive-installer.html) into an available port and power on the node.

1. When the node begins to boot, enter the boot menu.

   {% include note.html content="The boot setting is persistent: When you boot from a USB drive once, the node continues to boot from the USB drive. After you finish installing Qumulo Core, remove the USB drive from the node." %}

1. On the boot drive selection screen, select your USB drive (usually labeled with `UEFI OS`) and boot into it.
